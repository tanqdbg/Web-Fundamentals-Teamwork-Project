					<h2><span class="name">The Great Pindar Svetlin Nakov</span></h2>
					<p>Founder and great master of the Software Illuminati Nakov ‘s dreams go beyond  every man’s imagination.
					His goal is to make Bulgaria the most IT advanced country in the world  and use that to take over the
					world bringing The New World Order. Svetlin is powerful, arrogant and crushes his enemies source code to bits.
					If there is something this titan can’t do, that's finding the ANY key.</p>

					<h2><span class="name">Angel Georgiev</span></h2>
					<p>The smartest man in the organization and Nakov’s right hand. Angel's IQ is so high that
					few times in his life he managed to win an argument against a compilator.
					To be honest we've never seen him do anything productive for the organization
					besides this one time he succeeded hiding all of Nakov's weed in the basement from the
					policeman who visited the building.</p>

					<h2><span class="name">Bogomil Dimitrov</span></h2>
					<p>Bogomil is SoftUni Illuminati's boy for everything.
					He brings coffee to the whole office in the morning and massages Nakov’s
					feet when asked to. Mr. Dimitrov is probably the only one who realizes how
					stupid the idea behind the organization is, but he accepted Nakov's offer to join
					the council because he needed the money. Later on he found out that the council meetings can be
					great resource for his upcoming book "Software Engineers: The Stupidity".</p>

					<p>Borislav is SoftUni Illuminati's network engineer a.k.a the man responsible for everything that happens outside
					the building. He knows the browser history of every single member in the organization, that's why everyone
					panics when he is out of his office (a 2 by 2 meters dark cubicle).
					Someone once told us that he got a message from alien civilization and wrote it down on a piece of paper,
					but then he got distracted by the new Justin Bieber video and lost the note.</p>

					<p>Dido is one of the craziest people you'll ever get the chance to meet.
					Nakov hired him to be SoftUni Illuminati's activity manager
					(The only line of code Dido can write is: Console.WriteLine("Hello world"); ).
					And by activity manager we mean gathering the whole building in the gym and playing
					Ping-Pong with Nakov while the rest of the members play Angry Birds on their smartphones.</p>

				<div class="info">
					<h2><span class="name">Hristo Chakarov</span></h2>
					<p>Nobody knows what is he doing in the council not even Nakov.
					All we know about him is that he spends most of the time coding but no one knows exactly what.
					He doesn't speak often in meetings, but when he does, every single one of his sentences
					shows that he is an IT specialist: everything Hristo says is technically correct,
					but it's of no use to anyone. We heard that someone saw him eating glue.</p>

					<h2><span class="name">Ivan Yonkov</span></h2>
					<p>Yonkov is the creator of the organization's website
					(No! Not this one ! Wait.. what? Illuminati confirmed!) .
					He is also known for being intense keyboard ninja.
					Always ready to argue on the forums for basically everything.
					There is one day of the year when Ivan organizes debate on different
					Illuminati topics and the only one who shows up to work that day is Angel
					(We were told that they almost killed each other over an argument once).</p>

					<h2><span class="name">Ivan Vankov</span></h2>
					<p>He is like one of the Jehovah's Witnesses but instead of going to people's houses asking to talk
					with them about Jesus he goes to people's offices in the building asking them if they have time to
					talk about why Linux is better than Windows. Our sources tell us that he got his place in the
					council by winning Linux's contest for best fan art logo with his drawing of handicapped penguin.
					Ivan's coding skills are limited to drawing triangles in console with java.</p>

					<h2><span class="name">Marian Marinov</span></h2>
					<p>Just look at this wonderful gentleman in a white suit.
					Can you believe that he once was convicted for breaking into 5 government servers.
					Marian is one of the masterminds in the organization that keeps everything running while
					everyone else is drinking beer and scratching their backs. When we once asked him why is he
					late for work Mr. Marinov answered that he had to spend one hour beating his wife around the kitchen
					because his breakfast was cold(you don't want to to mess with this guy).</p>

					<h2><span class="name">Mario Peshev</span></h2>
					<p>You know that every organization or company have that one weirdo who annoys everyone to death?
					That's our guy! Mario is bearded weirdo who always comes to work with the same t-shirt that says:
					"Your mother is so fat that the recursive function calculating her mass causes stack overflow".
					And he always makes jokes about it. He hardly does any work and spends most of the time playing StarCraft 2.
					Onece he cried in his office for two weeks when he lost a game.</p>

				<div class="info">
					<h2><span class="name">Nikolay Bankin</span></h2>
					<p>This individual is mostly known for saying: "WTF is this crap? Why?"
					Well his role in the organization is to review everyone's code and make sure everything is
					working correctly which is a rare occasion. From time to time Niki is teaching
					and when that happens he spends half the lecture telling the students why he loves Mozilla
					and how he doesn't even have Chrome on his computer (suck it Chrome peasants).</p>

					<h2><span class="name">Stoyan Stoyanov</span></h2>
					<p>Stoyan is the head teacher in the academy and as such he has a granted spot in the council.
					No one in the council likes him because he talks way too much.
					Nakov told us that in the last meeting he spent two hours trying to convince the rest of the council
					that they need to change the type of toilet paper in the building's toilets, and by the time he was
					done talking, half the men in the room were asleep and the other half were playing poker.</p>

					<p>Vladi is the organization's priest. When he is not teaching the doctrines of the Illuminati to

					When once asked what is he writing he told that this will be the Illuminati bible (weird, huh).</p>

					<h2><span class="name">Yordan Darakchiev</span></h2>
					<p>This is the toilet cleaner and the only reason he is in the council is because of the lack of other suitable cadidates.
					Dancho won the award employee of the month once when he was the only man paying attention to Stoyan
					during his talk about the type of toilet paper used in the toilets.</p>
