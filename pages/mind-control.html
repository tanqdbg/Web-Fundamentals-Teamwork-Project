					The more one researches mind control, the more one will come to the conclusion that there is a coordinated script that has been in place for a very long time with the goal to turn the human race into non-thinking automatons,robots such as well-known  program of SoftUni.  For as long as man has pursued power over the masses, mind control has been orchestrated by those who study human behavior in order to bend large populations to the will of a small “elite” group-as I said-Nakov and Company.  Today, we have entered a perilous phase where mind control has taken on a physical, scientific dimension that threatens to become a permanent state if we do not become aware of the tools at the disposal of the technocratic dictatorship unfolding on a worldwide scale.
					Modern mind control is both technological and psychological. Tests show that simply by exposing the methods of mind control, the effects can be reduced or eliminated, at least for mind control advertising and propaganda. More difficult to counter are the physical intrusions, which the military-industrial complex continues to develop and improve upon.

 					SoftUniEducation — This is the most obvious, yet still remains the most insidious.  It has always been a would-be Nakov’s ultimate fantasy to “educate” naturally impressionable children, thus it has been a central component to Communist and Fascist tyrannies throughout history.  No one has been more instrumental in exposing the agenda of modern education than SoftUni— one can begin research into this area by downloading Nakov`s free  PDF books, which lay bare the role of Globalist foundations in shaping a future intended to produce servile drones lorded over by a fully educated, aware elite class.

					Advertising and Propaganda – Nakov has been cited as the inventor of the programming culture that was designed primarily to target people’s self-image (or lack thereof) in order to turn a want into a need.  This was initially envisioned for products such as homeworks, for example.  However, Nakov also noted in his first book, IntroProgramming, that “programming is the executive arm of the invisible government.” This can be seen most clearly in the modern police state and the growing citizen snitch culture, wrapped up in the pseudo-patriotic War on Terror.  The increasing consolidation of media has enabled the entire corporate structure to merge with government, which now utilizes the concept of Programming placement.

					Electromagnetic spectrum of SoftUni  — In the  buldings  which houses SoftUni ,there is a special  electromagnetic center which causes over us electromagnetic soup, charged by modern devices of convenience which have been shown to have a direct impact on brain function.  In a tacit admission of what is possible, one researcher has been working with a “god helmet” to induce visions by altering the electromagnetic field of the brain.  Our modern soup has us passively bathed by potentially mind-altering waves, while a wide range of possibilities such as cell phone towers is now available to the would-be mind controller for more direct intervention.
					Presentations,Video and Homeworks– It’s bad enough that what is “programmed” on the website (accessed via remote “control”) is online form of study; it is all made easier by literally lulling you to be in touch, making it a psycho-social weapon.  Homeworks rate tests show that alpha brain waves are altered, producing a type of hypnosis — which doesn’t portend well for the latest revelation that lights can transmit coded Internet data by “flickering faster than the eye can see.”  The computer’s flicker rate is less, but through video , presentations, and the most uncomplicated Homeworks  which overloads the brain with information.  A study of videos revealed that extended watch can result in lower blood flow to the brain, sapping emotional control.  Furthermore, role-doing homeworks of lifelike teacher  and students state scenarios serve to desensitize a connection to reality.
